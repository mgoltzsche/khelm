# How to contribute

Contributions, questions and feedback are welcome.
There are just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Community guidelines

This project follows the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Creating issues

Feedback, questions, bug reports and feature requests are welcome in form of issues.
Though before creating an issue please have a look [here](https://github.com/mgoltzsche/khelm/issues) if the issue doesn't exist already in order to avoid duplicates.
When you cannot find a corresponding issue please create a [new one](https://github.com/mgoltzsche/khelm/issues/new/choose).

### Bug reports

When reporting a bug please answer the following questions:
* Which environment and version do you use? Does it happen with the latest version as well?
* What did you do and what happened? (in a reproducible way ideally)
* What do you expect instead?

### Feature requests

When creating a feature request please answer the following questions:
* What is the problem?
* What do you want to change?
* How do you want it to behave?
* Why do you need it?
* Which alternatives did you consider?

## Creating pull requests (PRs)

While there is no need to create an issue before creating a PR please consider discussing large changes within an issue first.

When creating a PR please follow these rules:
* Create one PR per feature.
* Provide one commit per PR.
* Provide a description with each PR and commit that links an issue (if any), describes the problem, how it was solved and how the solution changes the user-facing behaviour.
* All submissions require a review.
* All commits should be signed using PGP and a [DCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developer_Certificate_of_Origin). This can be done using `git commit -s -S`.
* When submitting a bug fix or feature PR please also provide tests.
* When submitting a new feature please document it.
